## Change of the default TLS library used for C2S connections

As of this release, usage of `fast_tls` for Client to Server connections (C2S) has been deprecated.
`fast_tls` will be removed in a future release.

From now on the default TLS library for C2S is `just_tls`, which uses TLS implementation from Erlang OTP.
In our load tests `just_tls` is as performant as `fast_tls` and also has better standards compliance.

This deprecation affects only C2S, `fast_tls` remains as a TLS implementation for S2S.

To continue using `fast_tls` for C2S in existing deployment after upgrade, make sure the
option `tls.module` is set to `fast_tls` in `listen.c2s` section of your MongooseIM config.

### Channel binding for TLS

Note that `just_tls` currently does not implement `channel binding` for TLS, which is required for SCRAM_PLUS
authentication methods. If you depend on using SCRAM_PLUS for authentication, you need to use `fast_tls`.
We do plan to implement `channel binding` for `just_tls` (only for TLS 1.3) in the future.

### TLS handshake

There is a difference between `fast_tls` and `just_tls` in client authentication behaviour during TLS handshake.

`fast_tls` doesn't verify client certificate during TLS handshake and relies on other mechanisms, like SASL,
to authenticate client. It may involve client certificate, but is executed after TLS handshake succeeded,
and in case of invalid certificate will result in an error reported in message stream.

`just_tls` by default verifies client certificate during TLS handshake
and aborts connection when client certificate is invalid. This is realised by the default settings in
`just_tls` of `verify_mode` set to `peer` and `disconnect_on_failure` set to `true`.

If you want to have the same behaviour for `just_tls` as it was in `fast_tls` regarding TLS handshake,
set `tls.disconnect_on_failure` to `false`. This is required for example when using SASL for client authentication.

It is also possible to completely disable client certificate verification during TLS
handshake in `just_tls` by setting `tls.verify_mode` to `none`.
